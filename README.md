# Policy Optimization for Financial Decision-Making

## ✨ Objective

This project is designed to assess the ability to handle a real-world machine 
learning problem from start to finish. We will take a public dataset, perform 
analysis, frame it for both supervised learning and reinforcement learning, build 
and train models, and—most importantly—critically analyze and compare their 
behaviors and outcomes.
